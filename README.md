# CoffeeTracker

CoffeeTracker is an application designed to help users track their coffee buying and drinking habits. Recognizing that buying coffee in cafes can be both expensive and addictive, this app aims to provide a seamless and efficient way for users to log their coffee purchases and homemade coffee consumption. The primary objectives of this project include:

- User-Friendly Interface: Ensuring the interface is quick, fluid, and easy to use, allowing users to effortlessly record their coffee purchases, specify the type (e.g., espresso, latte), the shop, and the price.

- Comprehensive Tracking: Enabling users to log both cafe-bought and homemade coffee, providing a complete overview of their coffee consumption.

- Reporting and Insights: Offering robust reporting features that summarize coffee consumption and expenditure over different time periods (week, month, year), helping users understand their habits and manage their spending.

- Advanced Features: Exploring additional features such as detecting the user's location via GPS to automatically identify coffee shops, and the potential to upload summary data to a web service in CSV file for further analysis.

## Privacy & Security
### Data Collection
User-Provided Data: The application collects data directly from users through manual input. This includes details of coffee purchases (type, shop, price) and the location where the coffee was bought.
### Data Usage
In-App Utilization: Collected data is used exclusively within the application to enhance user experience. This includes displaying historical records, generating statistical summaries, and providing insights into coffee consumption patterns.
### Data Sharing
No Data Sharing: Currently, the application does not share any user data with third parties.
### Data Storage
Cloud Storage: All data is securely stored in cloud storage provided by Firebase. To ensure user security, device IDs are not collected; instead, data is associated with a hashed UUID.
### User Rights
Data Access and Control: Users have full control over their data. They can access, update, or delete their records directly within the application through the provided functionalities.
Tracking
### Application Improvement: Tracking is implemented solely for the purpose of improving the application. No additional tracking is conducted beyond this scope.
Contact Information
### Support and Assistance: Users can contact the application developer for support or assistance via email or GitHub. The development team is committed to providing prompt and helpful responses to user inquiries.
This comprehensive approach ensures that CoffeeTracker not only meets its functional goals but also prioritizes user privacy and data security.
